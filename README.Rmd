`airpurifyr` makes it easy to grab air quality data from [OpenAQ](https://www.openaq.org).

## Installation

You can install the development version of `airpurifyr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("numbats/airpurifyr")
```

## Usage

### Setting you API key

You will need to register an API key, which you can do [here](https://explore.openaq.org/register). 
Keep note of the API key, and set it using `set_openaq_api_key()`.

If you are using the package regularly, you can set this API key using a `.Renviron` or inside your `.Rprofile`, but don't share it publicly!

### Getting data

To get data, use the function `get_measurements_for_location()`. You'll probably want to provide at least a country, and maybe a city. For example,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
melbourne_data <- get_measurements_for_location(country = "AU", city = "Melbourne")
```

You may also want to filter by _locations_, which are almost like suburbs but are dependent on the location of sensors. More info on the API fields can be found on the [OpenAQ Documentation](https://api.openaq.org/redoc#tag/v2).
